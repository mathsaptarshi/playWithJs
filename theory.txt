Every Angular app consists of a file named angular.json. This file will contain all the configurations of the app. While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application. Following is an image of the angular.json file:

"build": {
"builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
"options": {
"outputPath": "dist/angular-starter",
"index": "src/index.html",
"main": "src/main.ts",
"polyfills": "src/polyfills.ts",
"tsConfig": "tsconfig.app.json",
"aot": false,
"assets": [
"src/favicon.ico",
"src/assets"
],
"styles": [
"./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css",
"src/style.css"
]
}
}
